## Exploration of semantic-based taxonomies

This folder explores the use of semantic embeddings to create taxonomies of entities, with the goal of creating an ontology of the ARIA dataset. It leverages embeddings from the tags identified in articles extracted from OpenAlex, and uses them to cluster entities into groups. This taxonomy is assumed hierarchical.

Multiple options are explored to create the taxonomy, including:

- **Strict hierarchical clustering**: Iteratively cluster the entity embeddings using Agglomerative Clustering and KMeans. At each level, clustering is performed on the subsets that were created at the previous level. This allows for strict hierarchical entity breakdowns.
- **Strict hierarchical clustering with varying number of clusters**: Iteratively cluster the entity embeddings using KMeans. At each level, clustering is performed on the subsets that were created at the previous level. The number of clusters is proportional to the parent cluster size.
- **Fuzzy hierarchical clustering**: Cluster the entity embeddings using an array of methods, including KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN. Several levels of resolution are used, and the taxonomy is built by concatenating these. This allows for non-strict hierarchical entity breakdowns.
- **Hierarchical clustering using a dendrogram climb algorithm**: Reconstruct the dendrogram of the Agglomerative Clustering, and use it to create the taxonomy.
- **Hierarchical clustering using the centroids of parent-level clusters**: Cluster the entity embeddings using KMeans, and use the centroids of the clusters as nodes in subsequent levels of the taxonomy.
- **Meta clustering using the co-occurrence of terms in the set of clustering results**: Use outputs fromall previous clustering methods to create a tag co-occurrence matrix. Apply community detection algorithms to this matrix to create the taxonomy.

The utils for this notebook include all necessary functions to create the taxonomy, including class ClusteringRoutine that performs any of the clustering methods described above. The function run_clustering_generators is used to run all clustering methods andreturn the results in a dictionary. The function make_dataframe is used to create a dataframe with the results of the clustering methods. The function make_plots is used to create a series of plots to visualize the results of the clustering methods. The function make_cooccurrences is used to create a co-occurrence matrix of the clustering results. The function make_subplot_embeddings is used to create a series of subplots with the embeddings of the entities in the taxonomy.

### Sample dataset

We use a sample of 3,000 articles to showcase the different models. Tags in these entities are filtered by selecting those with a confidence threshold higher than 80 and a minimum frequency above the 60th percentile of other entities.

### Strictly hierarchical clustering

The following clustering routine iteratively clusters the entity embeddings using Agglomerative Clustering and KMeans. At each level, clustering is performed on the subsets that were created at the previous level.

### Strict hierarchical clustering with imbalanced nested clusters

The following clustering routine iteratively clusters the entity embeddings using KMeans. At each level, clustering is performed on the subsets that were created at the previous level. The number of clusters at each level is allowed to vary, being determined by the size of the parent cluster.

### Fuzzy hierarchical clustering

The following approach iteratively clusters the entity embeddings using any sklearn method that supports the `predict_proba` method. No notion of level exists through this approach: more fine-grained clusterings are agnostic about the parent cluster output. Including several lists of parameter values will produce outputs for the Cartesian product of all parameter values within a clustering method.

DBSCAN and HDBSCAN are unable to output meaningful clusters given a set of parameters (DBSCAN: eps 0.05 & 0.1, min_samples 4 & 8; HDBSCAN: min_cluster_size 4 & 8, min_samples 4 & 8), where each column in the subplot corresponds to one pairing of parameters.

### Using dendrograms from Agglomerative Clustering (enforces hierarchy)

This approach uses a single run of any sklearn clustering method that supports a children_ attribute. The children_ attribute is used to recreate th dendrogram that produced the clustering, which is then used to create the taxonomy. The climbing algorithm advances one union of subtrees at a time. The number of levels is determined by the `dendrogram_levels` parameter.

### Centroids of Kmeans clustering as children nodes for further clustering (Ã  la [job skill taxonomy](https://github.com/nestauk/skills-taxonomy-v2/tree/dev/skills_taxonomy_v2/pipeline/skills_taxonomy))

This approach uses any number of nested KMeans clustering runs. After a given level, the centroids of the previous level are used as the new data points for the next level.![1671700624717](image/README/1671700624717.png)![1671700732629](image/README/1671700732629.png)

### Silhouette Scores

We compute silhouette scores to inform the relative performance of each method at their respective level. Note that these are not fine tuned, and as such levels are not comparable across methods.

### Meta Clustering

Following the approach of Juan in the [AFS repository](https://github.com/nestauk/afs_neighbourhood_analysis/tree/1b1f1b1dabbebd07e5c85c72d7401107173bf863/afs_neighbourhood_analysis/analysis), we combine the clustering methods to produce a matrix of entity co-occurrences. The objective is to apply community detection algorithms on this.
